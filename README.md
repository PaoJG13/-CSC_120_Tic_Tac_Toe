# -CSC_120_Tic_Tac_Toe

The following code is meant to be a simplified version of tic tac toe. The user is prompted to input the row and column number they'd like to mark as theirs. Player 1 will use an "X" to mark the position they desire, while player 2 will use a "O." Players can win by getting a line of three consecutives markings, meaning a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal win.
